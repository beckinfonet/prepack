- start from the top
- replace everything by divs
- watch the junk
- eliminate and repeat

weird:
- Env.js global assignment
- a bunch of requires that are unsafe to remove (fbt calls?)
- composer plugins suck

- next: weird conditional UFI2TopReactions (UFI2TopReactions_renderLink)
  - seems to be due to map (and lack of nest opt fun)
  - can't evaluate map if props are abstract, so `this` is needed!

- next: legit classes that bailed out

- next:
  - onMouseEnter etc obj-assign
  - "fixed" by replacing all bad boi functions with dummies
